    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
  </div>

<div>
  <p>
    Alina has participated in many different types of sports, including <a href="https://olympics.com/en/sports/water-polo/"> Water Polo,</a>
    Swimming, Ballet, Soccer, Fencing and cross country. Those team sports have taught her a lot about what it means to work well with others,
    and how to celebrate team success in spite of personal failure. The sports have given a valuable perspective of life overall, and she 
    is grateful to have had both the opportunity to participate, as well as the support system (such as parents giving rides and coaches offering insight)
    which allowed her experience to be a possibility.
  </p>
  <p>
      Not only has Alina had experience with sports, she also loves baking, especially <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sourdough">sourdough bread.</a>
      When she's not in the kitchen, she loves being outside, and is always up for a hike in nature, or other forms of exercise. She enjoys spending time 
      with friends and family.

  <h2>Career</h2>
</div>

<div>
  <p>
    Alina wants to be a <a href="https://www.indeed.com/hire/job-description/data-analyst"> Data Analyst </a> (which may eventually turn into a Data Science position), preferably working in the Finance industry. 
    The job responsibilities of a data analyst include the analysis of data, creation of data models, and present the data findings in a meaningful way.
    In simple terms, data analysts are given data from the company, and they need to manipulate and work with that data until they find whatever trends 
    and information the data can give them. After that, those findings must be displayed in a meaningful way in order to inform company decision making. 
    For the data analyst position, a Bachelor's degree is required, but a graduate degree is recommended. In the Data Science position, a graduate degree 
    is a minimum requirement, but a phD is recommended. Alina fully expects needing to get a graduate degree, but wants to have some 
    experience under her belt (such as her summer internship in Data Science and AI) before making a decision. Getting a job as a Data Analyst and having
    the company she works for pay for a graduate degree would also be a bonus.
